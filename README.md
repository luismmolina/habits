# Habits

This is a list of my current habits and routines

## Food

Currently I'm eating every day the same food. It is easy to count calories and I can keep track of what to buy or what to change.

_Breakfast_:

- Oatmeal with Coconut Milk

_Second Breakfast_:

- 2 Eggs
- 1 Slice of bacon
- 1 Slice of toasted bread with butter
- 2 Mushrooms with onions

_Meal_:

- 1 Bell Pepper
- 3 Mushrooms
- 1 Zucchini
- 1/2 Avocado
- Few Pieces of Broccoli
- Onion
- I use garlic, salt, pepper, curry and sriracha for additional flavor.

_Dinner_:

I still don't know exactly what to eat for dinner. One option is not to have dinner, but I need to eat more calories during the day.

## Sleep

I have tried to sleep for 6 hours, but after 3 weeks I realize that I need more time. I will increment my sleep by 30 min, until I find the right amount.

App being used at the moment "Alarmy", with an alarm that can be deactivated by doing 100 steps.
